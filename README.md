# NodeStream Shell

NodeStream shell is a set of tools that can be used to easily get going with developing NodeStream-based profiles and projects.

## Dependencies
* [GIT](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
* [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com)
* [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush)
* curl (on Linux <code> sudo apt-get install curl</code>)

## Installing
* Clone the repository

                git clone git@github.com:WKLive/nosh.git ~/nosh


* Fetch composer (sensible defaults added to command here) 

                curl -s getcomposer.org/installer | php -d detect_unicode=Off -d date.timezone=UTC


* Install Composer

                cd ~/nosh
                ./composer.phar install


* Symlink Nosh to your bin

                sudo ln -s ~/Nosh/nosh.php /usr/bin/nosh


### Caveats
* it probably not a bad idea to have run (outside the ~/nosh dir) Vagrant before testing Nosh

                vagrant box add base http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
                vagrant init
                vagrant up


! don't forget to stop the initial Vagrant box and optionally destroy it

### Mac OS X Nosh install helper script
Can be found [here](https://github.com/sjugge/mac_setup/blob/master/nosh_setup.sh). This script will guide you through setting up Nosh on Mac OS X.
A more streamlined version that supports Homebrew installs of Drush and Composer, as well as a helper script for Linux is on the way...

## Access and Credentials
* Access via browser to the web root is defined in the Vagrant file: 192.168.50.2, you can add this entry to <code>/etc/hosts</code>

Mac OS X GUI hint: [Hosts.prefpane](https://github.com/specialunderwear/Hosts.prefpane)

### MySQL
* host: 192.168.50.2
* user: root
* pass: password

### SSH

## Setting up projects with Nosh

### New Vagrant based project
